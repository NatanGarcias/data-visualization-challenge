            <p>This year's BioVis conference proposed to students and researchers a challenge to auxiliate medic professionals in diagnostics using visualization tools, aiming to increase their accuracy and efficience. During the diagnostics process, hereditary factors (e.g. family's historic cases) allow doctors to recognize connections between pacient and the source of the envolved clinical atributes.
           	By the time the numbers of pacients increase, it becames not viable to look patients clinical atributes individually, hiding their connection.

          <div>There are presented <b>two different datasets</b>, containing informations about <b>nine families</b> from Utah (USA):</div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>"Family Attributes", containing information about family individuals. </li>
              <li>"Family Structure", indicating families structure and its generation degrees. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="img-container">

          <div>
            <p>The topic studied in this challenge is a delicate one, the incidence of suicides in these families. For people who are already gone, clinical attributes such as depression, personality problems, cardiovascular problems, among others, are presented (when present). The study of these attributes in the context of a family allows to identify similarities between patients and then help experts to better understand the scenario that each one faces.</p>
